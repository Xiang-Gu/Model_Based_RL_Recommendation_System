    "## 1. User Model \n",
    "In the first part of this notebook, we built up the user model part for our model-based approach to the recommendation problem. The user model consists of two parts -- a state representation model and a reward prediction model. The goal is to train such a model that takes as input a user's historical record $(a_1,r_1, ..., a_{t-1},r_{t-1},a_t)$ and output/predict what the user's feedback r_t will be. Formally, try to train a model $\\hat{r}$ parameterized by $\\theta$ such that $\\hat{r}_\\theta(o_{t-1},a_t) \\approx r(o_{t-1}, a_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Representation Model\n",
    "We used a RNN layer to encode historically records of an user, $(a_1,r_1, a_2,r_2,..., a_{t-1},r_{t-1})$, into a fixed-length vector which we call $S_t$. Notice that the size of the input of the RNN (user's historical records) gradually increases over time so we decided to use a RNN to convert it into a fixed-length vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward Prediction Model\n",
    "After getting our state representation of the user's history, we concatenate it with the user's latest action a_t and feed it into a simple fully-connected layer to output our prediction of $\\hat{r}_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Item/Action Embedding\n",
    "One extra thing we did is to embed each item (or action) in the store into a vector in some high-dimensional space. For example, say we have in total 10,000 items in the repository, and we index each item with a number between 1 and 10,000. When we have a user's historical records and want to feed into the model, we need to feed all those actions $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_{t-1}, a_t)$ into a embedding layer first.\n",

Since our algorithm concerns the problem of learning a good recommendation policy via interaction with the user, we will try to test how good the performance of our model/algorithm is by measuring the learning process with interactive recommendation experience with user. However, one big problem is that it is commercially impractical to test our algorithm by putting our recommendation model/algorithm online and let it interact with real customers. Therefore, we build an environment simulator that tries to mimic the customer's feedback/reward on recommended items based on public recommendation dataset.

    "1. Pre-train a user model. We initialize a (random) policy $\\pi_\\theta(S,A)$ and use it to interact with the (simulated) environment and collect a set of interactive data $\\{(A_1^{(1)},R_1^{(1)},\\dots,A_T^{(1)},R_T^{(1)}), (A_1^{(2)},R_1^{(2)},\\dots,A_T^{(2)},R_T^{(2)}), \\dots, (A_1^{(K)},R_1^{(K)},\\dots,A_T^{(K)},R_T^{(K)}) \\}$, where $A_t^{(k)}$ represents the action taken in time step $t$ for user $k$ and $R_t^{(k)}$ accordingly stands for the reward/feedback from user $k$ for the recommended item $A_t^{(k)}$. We then use this dataset to train a user model. (Or, load the user model with a saved weights)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the Dyna algorithm to learn a good recommendation policy. Start by randomly picking up an user and run the dyna algorithm with this user (`user_id`) for several steps (`max_iterations`, `max_planning_steps`). Add the return value (a list of (real) interactive history of this user) to a replay buffer, which is a fixed length deque of lists. Then we repeat the whole process by randomly selecting another user. We repeat this process until `buffer_ratio_retrain` ((0, 1] e.g. 1/3) data in the replay buffer is replaced by the new ones. Then we go to step 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** it is unknown. Maybe try both! Currently we don't.\n",
    "    \n",
    "~~`Question:`~~ What about the discounting factor $\\gamma$? Do we use it in our update?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Don't use it at this moment. Maybe Try it if I have time! \n",
    "    \n",
    "`Question:` When t goes up, the user's historical records increases (ob becomes a long long list), which affects the speed of computing many functions needed to update the policy. Is it reasonable for us to keep track of only the most recent K records as our observation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** No, since the observation sequence won't get too long.    \n",
    "\n",
    "~~`Question:`~~ When we fill in the replay buffer with interactive experience with the user, a lot of (simulated) rewards are 0 not because they're actually 0 but rather because they are unknown and we artificially set it to 0. Then when we use the replay buffer to train our user model (the reward prediction model), we are forcing the model to learn that the rewards for those actions are 0's, which might not be the case. We can try to use only experiences with real ratings to train the user model, but I am now not sure how to do it. Anyway, let's just do the former solution first and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~`Question:`~~ Parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "~~`Question:`~~ case study to understand its behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "`Question:` User model overfitting (poor generalization?)\n",
    "\n",
    "~~`Question:`~~ Try multi-step methods or eligibility trace for the policy-gradient method.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~`Question:`~~ What about a model-free solution but with experience replay?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Question:` $R_0$ might should be 2.5 rather than 0, because after normalization, $R_0$ becomes -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~`Question:`~~ Are precision@n, recall@n, f1@n really reasonable evaluation metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** precision@n: what if some user has just a few (say < n) relevant items, then precision@n for this user will never be able to get close to 1 no matter how good the recommendation policy is.\n",
    "\n",
    "recall@n: what if some user has NO relevant items (denominator is 0), should we set the recall@n for this user to 1, as we do in conventional recommendation systems? Also, the denominator is related to number of relevant items of the user, rather than related to n, so the range of recall@n is no longer [0,1] depending on the quality of the recommendation policy. Thus, I personally think it is no longer suitable metrics for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "f1@n: if recall@n does not make sense in the first place, how can f1@n, one quantity that relies on precision@n and recall@n, make sense?"
