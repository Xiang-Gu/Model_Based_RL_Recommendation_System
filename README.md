# Model_Based_RL_Recommendation_System
My undergrad thesis project: Recommendation System -- An Model-based RL Approach

If you want to run the code (written with jupyter notebook), you need to download the dataset from [https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/]. 
Extract it, find the file "rating.dat", copy-and-paste it to the same directory of this project (feel free to delete the other files. All we need is the rating.dat file).
